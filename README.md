# Research on Information Extraction based on Semantic Segmentation in OCR
[Research Documentation](https://github.com/Noba1anc3/MFCN/wiki/Layout-Analysis)

## Based on Rules
Aset of general rules for Information Extraction out of forms is designed and implemented independently.  
The accuracy rate of key-value pairs on more than 100 customs declaration invoices reaches 98%. 

## Based on Neural Network
MFCNN based on BERT is reproduced. A series of experiments are carried out in terms of training set requirements,  
training cost, model generalization, finetune for downstream tasks and parameter tuning.

## Based on Machine Learning
The experiment of LightGBM Feature Engineering makes the F1 score of one shot learning exceed 0.9.
